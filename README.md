# Chatting-App

A week-long project focused on building a basic chatting application using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with minimal external dependencies.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Weekly-Projects series aimed at exploring web technologies and building practical applications. The goal is to create a functional chatting app that demonstrates core web development concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- **HTML**: Structure and semantic markup for chat interfaces
- **CSS**: Styling, layouts, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, and basic networking concepts
- **Documentation**: Writing clear project documentation
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration workflows

## Project Structure

Each team member (Boris and Oscar) will develop their own implementation with:

- Individual approach and design choices
- Shared core concept of a chatting application
- Personal folders for independent development

## Features to Implement

### Core Features

- [ ] User interface for sending and receiving messages
- [ ] Message display with timestamps
- [ ] User identification/naming
- [ ] Message history persistence (localStorage)
- [ ] Basic emoji support

### Advanced Features (Optional)

- [ ] Multiple chat rooms/channels
- [ ] Message editing/deletion
- [ ] File/image sharing
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Message search functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Must Use

- Pure HTML5 for structure
- Vanilla CSS3 for styling (no frameworks like Bootstrap)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for functionality
- Local Storage for data persistence

### Minimal External Dependencies Allowed

- Google Fonts or similar for typography
- Icon libraries (Font Awesome, etc.)
- Basic WebSocket library if implementing real-time features

### Not Allowed

- CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- JavaScript frameworks/libraries (React, Vue, jQuery, etc.)
- Backend frameworks (focus on frontend-only solution)

## Development Approach

1. **1 Week**: Basic chat interface and core functionality
2. **Individual Implementation**: Each developer creates their own solution
3. **Documentation**: Document design decisions and learning outcomes
4. **Comparison**: Compare different approaches at the end of the week

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Functional chat interface
- ✅ Message sending and receiving
- ✅ Data persistence between sessions
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Proper documentation
